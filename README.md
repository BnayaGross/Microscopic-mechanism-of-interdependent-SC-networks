# Microscopic-mechanism-of-interdependent-SC-networks
The files in this folder refer to the microscopic mechanism of interdependent superconducting networks studied in the article entitled "The microscopic origin of abrupt transitions in interdependent systems" and freely accessible at https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03050

The folder "MATLAB code" contains the codes needed to track the resistance changes in time of both networks with constant temperature and different currents. This allows us to observe an abrupt transition when the system reaches a steady state and to capture the plateau behavior during the transition. The main code is in the file "SC_dependent_networks_currents_simple.m" .
